Set 7
1. ArrayList<Actor> getActors()
void processActors(ArrayList<Actors> actors)
ArrayList<Location> getMoveLocations()
Location selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs)
void makeMove (Location loc)

2.A critter gets a list of actors to process, then processes 
them and uses this info to generate the locations to which it can 
move. After that, it picks a location from the list and moves there.

3.When it processes a unique set of actors different from the
ones in the getActors method in critter

4. A critter could randomly select an actor, select an actor based 
on one or more of the actor's traits, or select the actor based on
their location relative to the critter. 

5.You need to get the possible locations that the critter can move to
using getMoveLocation, then choose one of these locations with 
selectMoveLocation, then move to the selected location with makeMove.

6.There is no Critter constructor because the critter doesn't really
have it's own traits, I think. 

Set 8
1. Because chalmeleon critter overrides processActors and makeMove, which 
are both used in the act() method and effect its outcome.

2. Because it does everything that the regular Critter makeMove does, 
it just also does something additional.

3. By using the move from the actor class rather than the 
move method in the critter class.

4. It doesn't need to because it processes the same set of actors as the
getActors method for Critters states.

5. Actor? Maybe?

6. Dunno.

Set 9
1. It uses the conventional way of processing actors.

2. It eats anything in the front, right-front, or left-front of it as long as it's 
not a rock or a critter. 

3. Because of the crab's dietary restrictions, it needs to know that
the actor is in front, right-front, or left-front of the crab.

4. (4,3); (4,4); (4,5);

5. The crab moves like a critter but with more restrictions, since
it can only move left or right

6.It turns if neither the spot to its left nor the spot to its
right are empty.

7. Because they were told not to eat other critters, and they are
both subclasses of critter so they can't eat eachother.
