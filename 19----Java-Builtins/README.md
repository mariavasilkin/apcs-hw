HashMap vs. HashSet --> in a HashMap, keys point to their values. A key can't point to more than one value, 
  but multiple keys can point to the same value. In a HashSet, values are organized in a set using the key as the index.
  Values cannot be repeated. HashSet uses HaspMap in its implementation.
